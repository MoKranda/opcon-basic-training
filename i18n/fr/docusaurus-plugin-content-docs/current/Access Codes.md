### Access Code Privileges

* To implement Access Codes for securing Jobs, each User must have appropriate Access Code Privileges through one or more Roles to view and update Jobs
* ```<None>``` is the default Access Code for all Jobs
    * All Roles automatically have Privileges to update any Jobs with ```<None>``` Access Code
* When additional Access Codes are created, the Administrator must grant Privileges for Access Codes to the appropriate Role Name
