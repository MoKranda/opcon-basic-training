* OpCon supports several types of Calendars to help provide flexible scheduling around holidays and any other non-working days 

* **Master Holiday Calendar**
  * Installed with OpCon database
  * Stores non-working days for multiple Schedules
  * By default, there are no non-working days on this Calendar, so administrators must set any desired non-working days
  * These non-working days affect all Schedules that are configured to use the Master Holiday Calendar
* **Additional Holiday Calendar**
  * User-defined Calendars
  * Stores non-working days that can be associated with multiple Schedules
  * Administrators can create as many Additional Holiday Calendars as needed for automation
  * Non-working days on these Calendars only affect Schedules that have a Calendar selected for Additional Holidays
* **Individual Holiday Calendar**
  * Automatically created when a Schedule is initially created
  * Stores non-working days for a single Schedule
  * Administrators must set additional days as non-working days when required
